Abstract: This case study delves into GitHub, one of the world's largest platforms for software development and collaboration. It explores GitHub's developmental models, licensing policies, mode of funding, and the diverse landscape of commercial and non-commercial use. This study sheds light on how GitHub has transformed the software development ecosystem.Developmental Models: GitHub facilitates a decentralized and collaborative developmental model. It serves as a hosting platform for version control repositories, primarily using Git. Developers and teams worldwide contribute to projects through distributed development, pull requests, and issue tracking. GitHub's model emphasizes open collaboration, enabling developers to work together irrespective of geographic location.Licensing: GitHub is agnostic when it comes to licensing software hosted on its platform. Users can choose various open-source licenses, such as MIT, GPL, or Apache, or even proprietary licenses for their projects. GitHub's flexibility allows developers to align their licensing choices with project goals, promoting a wide range of software licensing models.Mode of Funding: GitHub operates on a combination of revenue streams. It offers paid services to individuals and organizations, including private repositories and enterprise solutions. Additionally, GitHub receives funding through sponsorships, where users can financially support open-source projects hosted on the platform. This diverse mode of funding supports both GitHub's operation and the broader open-source community.Commercial/Non-Commercial Use: GitHub is a versatile platform catering to both commercial and non-commercial use cases. Many companies use GitHub to manage proprietary codebases, collaborate on software development, and streamline workflows. Simultaneously, it serves as a hub for countless open-source projects, where individuals and organizations contribute to projects without the intention of commercial gain. GitHub's ecosystem accommodates a wide spectrum of users, fostering a vibrant software development community.
